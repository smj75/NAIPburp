# NAIPburp
Model carbon emissions from the North Atlantic Igneous Province

NAIPburp contains multiple stochastic models for carbon-based greenhouse gas emissions from the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP).  These histories were calculated using code in GitHub repositories smj75/sillburp and smj75/LIPburp.  

The primary reference is, "Jones, S. M., Hoggett, M., Greene, S. E. & Dunkley Jones, T.,  Large Igneous Province thermogenic greenhouse gas flux could have initiated Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum climate change, Nature Communications, in press Sept 2019."

There are 3 types of information here.

(1) DATASETS of NAIP sill province dimensions that were used to generate the results.

(2) RESULTS of emissions modelling using constant values of trepeat

(3) Results of emissions modelling where t
